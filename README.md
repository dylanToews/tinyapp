# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This project was built by Dylan Toews, along with the much needed help of the "Request Assistance" button at Lighthouse Labs. This project was built as part of a Web Development Bootcamp, and as of such any and all who use this application should use caution.
